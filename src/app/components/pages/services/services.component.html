      <h3>Front End Development</h3>
      <p>
        Let's get our hands dirty and build a Web App together! I'm a big fan of
        React, Angular and Vue and would love to hear more about your project
        and how I could help.
      </p>

      <h3>Build An App</h3>
      <p>
        Have you got an idea for the next Uber? Please let me know so I can
        build it for you and you can become a millionaire! Best idea I had was
        Tinder for pets, strangely it hasn't taken off yet...
      </p>
      <h3>Cross Platform Development</h3>
      <p>
        Oh boy do I love a bit of Cross Platform Development! If React Native,
        Ionic or Flutter get you excited, then we need to have a chat.
      </p>
      <h3>I Ran Out Of Ideas</h3>
      <p>
        I felt it important to have three headers for each section. But I ran
        out of ideas for this one. So this is just a filler so it looks better.

      <h3>APIs</h3>
      <p>
        APIs are the language of the internet, they are how your Website and
        Mobile App get their data to display to the user. If you want to sound
        super fancy, you shouuld totally get one of these! I like using C# Web
        APIs and Node.js.
      </p>
      <h3>Databases</h3>
      <p>
        Databases are where you store all your data for your Website or Mobile
        App. If you have some data to store, then you will probablly need one of
        these! I like using MS SQL Server, MySQL and (if I'm felling hip) some
        NoSQL.
      </p>
      <h3>Dev Ops & CI/CD</h3>
      <p>
        Dev Ops is adding lots of awesome automation to make your development
        process faster and more stable. I like using Azure Pipelines, GitLab
        Runners and Github Workflows.
